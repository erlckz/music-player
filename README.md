## <a name="introduction">❔ Introduction</a>

This is a basic system created with only 3 languages, namely HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With the aim of allowing you to customize it with your favorite songs without ads and to your taste, the system consists of a fully configurable music player.

To configure it, simply open the <b>script.js</b> file and configure it. It is very simple and compact. It is my first source code and I hope you like it.
